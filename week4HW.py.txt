#Objective: Make a program that calculates how long it will take (how many hours) to make $10,000 if you make $25 an hour and work 100 hours a week.

hours = 0
hourlyProfit = 25
totProfit = 0

while (totProfit < 10,000):
  hours+=1
  totProfit += hourlyProfit

print("After {} hours, you will finally make $10,000.".format(hours))

#Note that a free replit account may not be able to run this program due to the sheer size of code.
